The Merchant of Venice,['William Shakespeare'],Hal Leonard Corporation,1998,"(Applause Books). If there ever has been a groundbreaking edition that likewise returns the reader to the original Shakespeare text, it will be the Applause Folio Texts. If there has ever been an accessible version of the Folio, it is this edition, set for the first time in modern fonts. The Folio is the source of all other editions. The Folio text forces us to re-examine the assumptions and prejudices which have encumbered over four hundred years of scholarship and performance. Notes refer the reader to subsequent editorial interventions, and offer the reader a multiplicity of interpretations. Notes also advise the reader on variations between Folios and Quartos. The heavy mascara of four centuries of Shakespearean glossing has by now glossed over the original countenance of Shakespeare's work. Never has there been a Folio available in modern reading fonts.

The Tragedy of Hamlet,['William Shakespeare'],Graphic Arts Books,2022-01-11,"Hamlet (1601) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. Inspired by Danish historian Saxo Grammatica’s legend of Amleth, which Shakespeare likely encountered in a retelling by French scholar Francois de Belleforest, Hamlet was written sometime between 1599 and 1601. Alongside Romeo and Juliet, it is one of Shakespeare’s most performed plays and has served as source material for countless film and television adaptations. “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” For his wit and wordplay alone, William Shakespeare is often considered the greatest writer to ever work in the English language. Where he truly triumphs, however, is in his ability to portray complex human emotions, how these emotions contribute to relationships, and how these relationships interact with politics, culture, and religion. Hamlet is a story of things seen and unseen. Ghosts, assassins, shadowy plots, a play within a play, lengthy asides—its universe swirls with paranoia and fear, allowing us to enter the mind of its troubled protagonist. When the ghost of his father appears on the castle rampart, Danish prince Hamlet grows increasingly suspicious of his uncle Polonius’ role in the former king’s death. As his relationships with Ophelia, his lover, and Gertrude, his mother, begin to sour, Hamlet loses sight of his duties as a leader. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet is a classic of English literature reimagined for modern readers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781513210704'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '151321070X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",114,BOOK,['Drama'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NyJaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NyJaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.com/books?id=NyJaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Shakespeare&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NyJaEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NyJaEAAAQBAJ,

As You Like It,['William Shakespeare'],Graphic Arts Books,2022-01-11,"As You Like It (1599) is a comedy by William Shakespeare. As You Like It was probably inspired by Thomas Lodge’s Rosalynd, Euphues Golden Legacie (1587), a story based on “The Tale of Gamelyn,” a Middle English romance. For its deconstruction of traditional gender roles and depiction of homoeroticism, As You Like It remains an important and frequently performed play in Shakespeare’s oeuvre. “All the world's a stage, / And all the men and women merely players; / They have their exits and their entrances; / And one man in his time plays many parts...” For his wit and wordplay alone, William Shakespeare is often considered the greatest writer to ever work in the English language. Where he truly triumphs, however, is in his ability to portray complex human emotions, how these emotions contribute to relationships, and how these relationships interact with politics, culture, and religion. When Frederick exiles the Duke and usurps his throne, he allows his daughter Rosalind to remain due to her close friendship with his daughter Celia. When Rosalind is blamed for a conflict between brothers Oliver and Orlando, Frederick banishes her from the duchy. Determined to remain together, the two friends disguise themselves and, joined by the court jester Touchstone, flee for the Forest of Arden. There, Rosalind—in the guise of Ganymede—and Celia—as Aliena—attempt to survive through the kindness of strangers and old acquaintances alike. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of William Shakespeare’s As You Like It is a classic of English literature reimagined for modern readers.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781513210674'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '151321067X'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",83,BOOK,['Drama'],NOT_MATURE,False,0.3.2.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSJaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSJaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.com/books?id=MSJaEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:Shakespeare&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MSJaEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MSJaEAAAQBAJ,
