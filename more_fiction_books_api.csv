The Plague,,['Albert Camus'],Vintage,1991-05-07,"“Its relevance lashes you across the face.” —Stephen Metcalf, The Los Angeles Times • “A redemptive book, one that wills the reader to believe, even in a time of despair.” —Roger Lowenstein, The Washington Post A haunting tale of human resilience and hope in the face of unrelieved horror, Albert Camus' iconic novel about an epidemic ravaging the people of a North African coastal town is a classic of twentieth-century literature. The townspeople of Oran are in the grip of a deadly plague, which condemns its victims to a swift and horrifying death. Fear, isolation and claustrophobia follow as they are forced into quarantine. Each person responds in their own way to the lethal disease: some resign themselves to fate, some seek blame, and a few, like Dr. Rieux, resist the terror. An immediate triumph when it was published in 1947, The Plague is in part an allegory of France's suffering under the Nazi occupation, and a timeless story of bravery and determination against the precariousness of human existence.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780679720218'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0679720219'}]","{'text': False, 'image': False}",312,BOOK,['Fiction'],4.5,14.0,NOT_MATURE,False,1.1.1.0.preview.0,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.com/books?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=KVGd-NabpW0C&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Plague.html?hl=&id=KVGd-NabpW0C

My Name Is Asher Lev,,['Chaim Potok'],Anchor,2009-07-01,"NATIONAL BESTSELLER • In this modern classic from the National Book Award–nominated author of The Chosen, a young religious artist is compulsively driven to render the world he sees and feels, even when it leads him to blasphemy. “A novel of finely articulated tragic power .... Little short of a work of genius.”—The New York Times Book Review Asher Lev is a Ladover Hasid who keeps kosher, prays three times a day and believes in the Ribbono Shel Olom, the Master of the Universe. He grows up in a cloistered Hasidic community in postwar Brooklyn, a world suffused by ritual and revolving around a charismatic Rebbe. He is torn between two identities, the one consecrated to God, the other devoted only to art and his imagination, and in time, his artistic gift threatens to estrange him from that world and the parents he adores. As it follows his struggle, My Name Is Asher Lev becomes a luminous, visionary portrait of the artist, by turns heartbreaking and exultant.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307422347'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307422348'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",385,BOOK,['Fiction'],4.5,4.0,NOT_MATURE,True,3.11.10.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kYcUeOR4bdoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kYcUeOR4bdoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.com/books?id=kYcUeOR4bdoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kYcUeOR4bdoC&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kYcUeOR4bdoC

He joins forces with Ippolit Matveyevich Vorobyaninov, a former nobleman who has returned to his hometown to find a cache of missing jewels which were hidden in some chairs that have been appropriated by the Soviet authorities. The search for the bejeweled chairs takes these unlikely heroes from the provinces to Moscow to the wilds of Soviet Georgia and the Trans-caucasus mountains; on their quest they encounter a wide variety of characters: from opportunistic Soviet bureaucrats to aging survivors of the prerevolutionary propertied classes, each one more selfish, venal, and ineffective than the one before.","[{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0810114844'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780810114845'}]","{'text': True, 'image': True}",420,BOOK,['Fiction'],5.0,1.0,NOT_MATURE,False,1.7.11.0.preview.3,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ru58xAaPZxcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ru58xAaPZxcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ru58xAaPZxcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Ru58xAaPZxcC&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Twelve_Chairs.html?hl=&id=Ru58xAaPZxcC
For Whom the Bell Tolls,The Hemingway Library Edition,['Ernest Hemingway'],Simon and Schuster,2019-07-16,"Introduced by Hemingway’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this newly annotated edition and literary masterpiece about an American in the Spanish Civil War features early drafts and supplementary material—including three previously uncollected short stories on war by one the greatest writers on the subject in history. In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight,” and one of the foremost classics of war literature in history. Published in 1940, For Whom the Bell Tolls tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Robert Jordan is a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo’s last stand, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. “If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,” Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, “no one ever so completely performed it.” Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author’s previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time. Featuring early drafts and manuscript notes, some of Hemingway’s writings during the Spanish Civil War, and three previously collected stories of his on the subject of war, as well as a personal foreword by the author’s son Patrick Hemingway, and a new introduction by the author’s grandson Seán Hemingway, this edition of For Whom the Bell Tolls brings new life to a literary master’s epic like never before.","[{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476787831'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476787832'}]","{'text': True, 'image': False}",576,BOOK,['Fiction'],,,NOT_MATURE,True,1.11.9.0.preview.2,"{'containsEpubBubbles': False, 'containsImageBubbles': False}","{'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}",en,http://books.google.com/books?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:Fiction&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jS2BDwAAQBAJ
Journey to the Center of the Earth,,['Jules Verne'],Bantam,2006-04-25,"The intrepid Professor Lindenbrock embarks upon the strangest expedition of the nineteenth century: a journey down an extinct Icelandic volcano to the Earth’s very core. In his quest to penetrate the planet’s primordial secrets, the geologist—together with his quaking nephew Axel and their devoted guide, Hans—discovers an astonishing subterranean menagerie of prehistoric proportions. Verne’s imaginative tale is at once the ultimate science fiction adventure and a reflection on the perfectibility of human understanding and the psychology of the questor.
